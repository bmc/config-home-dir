# config-home-dir

Simple script to configure my home directory on a new machine.

```
bash config.sh
```

or, if you're daring:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmc/config-home-dir/master/config.sh | bash
```

## Note to people not me

This script clones a bunch of my repos and installs bits of them. More than
a couple of those repos are public. You can try to run `config.sh`, but
it _will_ fail for you.
